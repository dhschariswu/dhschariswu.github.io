  <h3> My Ambition </h3>
  <p> When I grow up, I aspire to become a fashion designer or a fashion stylist. I am greatly interested in fashion and I hope that I would be able to pursue my dream and be successful in the future. I can take courses or lessons that would help me learn more about fashion and its design that can make me better understand and do better in my job.
